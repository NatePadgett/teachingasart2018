## Jacking into the mainframe

## Internet Generativity
or
## Webscraping and Datasets as Art


This workshop will be an introduction to hacker tools and techniques for appropriating data from the internet.

When we think about generative design, often the first thing that comes to mind is geometric shapes and patterns - However as we labour over various bouncing ball experiments in Processing we should not fail to consider that the internet is in itself a gigantic, data-driven generative system. I would like to encourage students to think more broadly  and critically about possibilities of 'Generativity' amidst the pulsating data megatropolis that is contemporary internet culture.

In order to take advantage of the generative nature of the internet we benefit from beginning a learning journey into basic automation, data appropriation and hacker tools.

This workshop will introduce students to the practice of web-scraping, command line and python scripting as the fundamental skills for artists wishing to engage critically with our current technological context.

We must tread carefully when it comes to any form of appropriation - which is why I would like to spend 15-20 minutes grounding the workshop in some critical notions of hacker culture and appropriation. I need to find some better resources for this but at the moment the concept of [Detourement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%A9tournement) seems relevant here - the notion of "Hijacking" cultural materials to counter or explicate an underlying ideology. [Hacker Manifesto](http://www.neme.org/texts/hacker-manifesto) is another relevant reference.

This workshop is initially being designed for students of ITP who are presumed to have a basic understanding of programming concepts. However, I imagine that it could be extended into a series of workshops for individuals with no prior experience.
