 ‘The performative nature of protest’ and the Parkland students ‘March for Our Lives’ rally.

“The truth is mass demonstrations are rehearsals for revolution:” John Berger

The Parkland students are demonstrators, activists and artists of this movement and protest. They have teeth in the game with purpose and evolve as the people who directly suffered by and have the most to lose or gain by the outcome. The ‘March for Our Lives’ rally and movement will continue and strengthen if it’s not co-opted by the adults in the room like the politicians, the media, the parents and the gun lobbyists. These youths showed they have the tools of modern social media to control the narrative and keep the message focused. This is activist art. 

I believe this young generation transcends labels of sexual orientation and racism and are not swayed or interested in being categorized by xenophobic naysayers.  They are constructing a narrative that has an intersectional approach and moves away from the ‘us against them’ mentality and strengthen the emotional connections of coming together with a focused rational and cause.

Emma Gonzalez, a senior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, and one of the most prominent faces of the student activist against gun violence, gave a captivating emotional speak at the March for our Lives rally in Washington. For six minutes and twenty seconds (the time it took the shooter to kill seventeen students and teachers), she spoke eloquently and then stood in silence captivating and connecting with us all. 

This is performance art of protest and activism that captures and drives the message. Emma Gonzalez used a radical form to make a radical message. She combined form and function and was reflective making us feel and not telling us how we should feel. She spoke emotionally and then stood in silence and had us live in our own discomfort. Demonstration to revolution.
