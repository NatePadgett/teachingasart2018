## Overview
This class will be an exploration on the ways on which our lives are influenced by patterns. There are many lenses to experience patterns - mathematical, visual, artistic, behavioral, musical, scientific, etc. Students will examine why patterns come into existence, how they might be influenced, and what that means in the context of our lives. As a part of the larger curriculum, students will engage with both their fellow students as well as local members of the community.

### Prerequisites
There are no prerequisites for this class however students will be expected to bring their outside knowledge to the class. This may require students to conduct their own research outside of class.

### Homework Expectations
Classes will go over more general topics that span a wide variety of fields. This is to give students a general sense, but for assignments students will delve more deeply specific topics of their choosing. All homework assignments have a short writing component (< 1 page), but students should also convey their ideas in mediums relevant to the topic they are exploring.

### Class Format
Classes are typically 75 minutes long, however activities in the syllabus will be account for an hour to allow some leeway for students and teachers.

## Weekly Schedule


### Week 1: Observing patterns
* *(20 min)*  Lecture on examples of patterns observed in the world
* *(20 min)*   Out of class activity - Observe as many patterns as possible without leaving school premises
* *(20 min)*  Debrief and group discussion on observations
* **Homework:** Describe 3 patterns that youâ€™ve observed or researched


### Week 2:  Understanding patterns
* *(15 min)*  Discuss and attempt to catalog patterns from homework
* *(20 min)*  Lecture on ways we try to quantify patterns and common connections between patterns
* *(25 min)*  In class activity - draw connections between patterns cataloged by the class
* **Homework:** Choose 1-2 patterns that fascinate you and attempt to explain why they exist


### Week 3: Making Patterns
* *(15 min)*  Discuss homework and share fascinating finds
* *(25 min)*  Introduce activity, break into groups, and spread out. Students will create their own patterns. Provide material and space for a variety of mediums as is manageable. Students may choose to make visual patterns, code,  musical rhythms, body movement/dance, etc. Students will document their patterns to explains its purpose and how other people can recreate it.
* *(20 min)*  Students will present their patterns to each other, attempt to teach their pattern to another group, make discussion, and critique.
* **Homework:** Find a member of the community and interview them on patterns in their lives. It may be their daily behavior patterns, patterns they make or see in their occupations, etc.


### Week 4: Breaking Patterns
* *(15 min)*  Discuss homework and share interesting discoveries
* *(25 min)*  Lecture on examples of when pattern breaks - include historical, scientific, behavioral examples especially. Discuss how/why some patterns might be robust or more easily broken.
* *(20 min)*  Teacher brings in an outside community member to talk about pattern breaking in their life. Discussion and questions.
* **Homework:** Find an example of when patterns break or have exceptions and explain how it has an effect outside of itself


### Week 5: Communicating Patterns
* *(10 min)*  A talk to wrap up the class and present general ideas of best practices for giving presentations.
* *(30 min)*  Work in groups to create 3-5 minute presentations on anything relating to patterns. Students must draw and convey their conclusions beyond describing information.
* *(20 min)*  Students give their presentations and give each other feedback.
