CLOUD POEMS AND INCOMPLETE THEOREMS

(Elective - 6 weeks - 2 credits)




 Cumulus
 
“Still soaring, as if some celestial call
Impell’d it to yon heaven’s sublimest hall;
High as the clouds, in pomp and power arrayed,
Enshrined in strength, in majesty displayed;
All the soul’s secret thoughts it seems to move,
Beneath it trembles, while it frowns above.”
Goethe.

Description

Johann Wolfgang von Goethe was one of the most celebrated intellectuals of the 19th
century, as a writer he was a bursting talent and a jewel for his country, but Goethe’s
prose not only flourished in his novels but in his scientific work. He wrote poems to 
the clouds, to the plants, to the forms of nature. In this class, students will learn 
about the history of different branches of science, their the impact or interweaving 
with the art, society and culture. We’ll discuss and elaborate around the contributions 
of biologist, mathematicians, composers and even actors. Readings, sketching, experi-
mentation and in-class lectures will give place to projects, the crazier the better. 


Materials

Readings will be provided to the student. A sketchbook is mandatory for all students of 
this class. 


Attendance

You are expected to attend all the sessions, if for medical or personal reasons you are 
unable to attend please inform in advance. Three unexcused absences will make you fail 
this class.


Assignments and projects

Two sketchbook entries (illustrations, poem, doodling, etc) per week.
One 5-10 minute's presentation about a topic/scientist/artist you want and is relevant 
under the context of the class. Two per session.

One final project has no requirements, it can be an experiment, a compilation of poems, 
even a painting. Just remember this is a final project and as such it must demonstrate
