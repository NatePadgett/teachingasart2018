## syllabus, digital identity
This assignment was incredibly difficult! Even following the framework became quite tiring, as you had to regurgitate much of the content, narrative, and sheer info again and again.

There’s still much to iron out, but I feel good about incorporating my curricular values and moving past “information” and into experience.

I originally sketched out all the items, then listed them, then listed again. An old draft of the syllabus on googledocs:

My syllabus is divided like this:
