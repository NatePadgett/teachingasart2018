## syllabus, digital identity
This assignment was incredibly difficult! Even following the framework became quite tiring, as you had to regurgitate much of the content, narrative, and sheer info again and again.

There’s still much to iron, but I feel good about incorporating my curricular values and moving past “information” and into experience.

I originally sketched out all the items, then listed them, then listed again. I also made this google doc, but it needs to be changed still: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gzeA0USVGuJ2PYWzW3sDqykNbQ1QUjnJc2XTyk0xFOA/edit#heading=h.8ifixpmdi0th
