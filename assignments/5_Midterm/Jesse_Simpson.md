**Workshop proposal:** A Collaborative Sense of Home

*This workshop will explore Lygia Clarkeâ€™s notions of self awareness, collaboration and sense, inviting participants to create a common project based on independent ideals.*   

**Preparation:**

Participants will begin the session by counting off 1-4 to be used later on in the workshop.  They will then be led through a 5-10 minute meditation session sitting on pillows.  Upon finishing, all of the 1s will be blindfolded; all of the 2s will wear noise canceling earmuffs; all of the 3s will have oven mitts placed over their hands; and all of the 4s will have tape (loosely) placed over their mouths.  

The group will then be presented with a series of objects: 
Paper
Scissors
Toothpicks
Popsicle sticks
Cotton balls
Legos
Tape
Textile swatches
String
Straws
Rubberbands
Paperclips
Cardboard slabs
Water

**Exercise:**

Participants will then be instructed to familiarize themselves with the assorted materials for two minutes.  Participants will then create a collective model designed to realize their own personal sanctuary (home).  

Participant 1 will have 1 minute or less to convey their intent using their remaining senses, and begin to construct the space.  Participant 2 will then have 1 minute or less to elaborate on the space/object under the same constraints.  This process will repeat for 30 minutes or until the group otherwise concedes that the space/object is complete.  No conversation is allowed between participants outside of their 1 minute time slots unless asked for help or a response from the lead participant.  No other restrictions apply outside of these parameters.
