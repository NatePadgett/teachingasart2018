### Setup

Crayons, pens, and pieces of paper are handed out to each participant.

Each piece of paper is divided into three sections:

- Where I came from
- What happened to me
- Who I am now

Participants are told to illustrate or write in the first and last panels.

Content can be written word, imagery, or a combination of both. Panels can be subdivided if desired.

### The Myth

Participants are told to fill the middle panel with something that connects the first panel with the last panel. The connecting panel can be fictitious, a twist on the truth, or based completely on the truth.

### Display

Completed comics are pinned up on a wall.
