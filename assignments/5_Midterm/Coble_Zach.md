Participants in this workshop will engage with Lygia Clark's 1966 piece, Pedra e Ar (Stone and Air). The workshop will contextualize the piece within Clark's ouvre, and specifically as point of departure in her career from abstract painting and sculpture to interactive works involving “sensorial” or “relational” objects where objects gain meaning through their contact with the human body.

The piece itself involves placing a stone inside a bag filled with air, and participants use their hands to move the stone within the bag. As the bag is squeezed, the stone rises or sinks, in a rhythmic motion similar to giving birth.

1. Facilitator discusses Lygia Clark's development as an artist and her relationship in the Brazilian art scene

3. Afterward, there is a guided discussion among the participants about their experience with the piece
