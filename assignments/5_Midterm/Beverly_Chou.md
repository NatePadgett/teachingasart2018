Robbe (Seal) by Joseph Beuys, 1983

## Workshop Goals

In this workshop we will explore the way that art and ideas can be social sculptures. We will give form to our ideas through drawing.

**Objectives:** Understand art as a way of affecting social change and understand your position in making art

## Workshop Summary

The first part of the workshop will be spent in a "ring discussion" (Ringgesprache), inspired by the ones that Josef Beuys' conducted while teaching at DÃ¼sseldorf Academy of Art. We'll have an open discussion on the role of art and artists in society.

Using the topics and ideas discussed, students will create a drawing that manifests his/her idea of his/her role as an artist in society. We will do an exquisite corpse by passing the original drawings along to each other several times. Each time the drawings are passed students will transform the previous based on Beuys' Theory of Sculpture.

At the end we will discuss what we've created and display the works outside of the classroom.
