This workshop explores art and sculpture as social actions capable of actualizing change and building community. 

The first 10 minutes of the workshop will be spent exploring and discussing social sculpture, collective action, and art as
a form of protest. 

We will spend the remaining 50 minutes of the workshop exploring a contemporary social issue determined by the group 
and developing a sculpture that will be staged or performed at the end of the session. Everyday materials from paper to 
felt will be on hand for participants to incorporate into their work, with the gallery functioning as their canvas. 
Participants must work as a group to develop the sculpture and tell a cohesive narrative, requiring trust and collaboration 
with each other. Through this, participants will collaborate on storytelling and manifestation of the action. 

This workshop is intended to be hosted at the [Five Myles](http://www.fivemyles.org/) gallery in Crown Heights. This 
neighborhood space hosts shows for local artists as well as live performances.
