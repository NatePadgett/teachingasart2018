# I, Too.
Loosely Inspired by : Lygia Clark’s “The Abandonment of Art”

## What is needed:
* 10 guests
* 2 researchers
* 1 moderator
* Paper & Black Sharpies

What happens:
As guests arrive within the first 10 minutes of the event, they are instructed to write out a secret or a personal truth that has made them feel uncomfortable at some point in their lives. Ideally, all guests are strangers to one another. Each guest receives a name tag with the name of their “alter-ego” for the event. - For their protection, guests should not use their real name during this time, however, they can choose to share as much about their lives as they want. Mingling takes place for about 40 minutes. While guests mingle, researchers are finding statistics of Americans (or people across the world, don’t know what scale this should take yet) who directly relate to the secret that has been shared. For the last 20 minutes of the event, guests read aloud randomized secrets or truths collected upon arrival. Moderator, with statistics in hand, directs the relative number of people in the room to respond “I, too”.

Goal:
Show people that while they may deal with their turmoil in solitude, that they are not truly alone in whatever that struggle is.
