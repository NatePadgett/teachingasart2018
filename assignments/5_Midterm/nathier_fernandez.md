-Warp and Weft-

![](img/wnw.JPG) 

Capacity: 10 people (max) per session
Duration: One hour


My workshop is based on Anni Albers life and work. I want to explore her story, her credo and technique. 
In order to understand an get to know someone's work, is crucial to get familiar with their story, context 
and thoughts. Especially if that person ended up being a fundamental figure of the 20th century. 

This workshop aims to be a space of experimentation, play and material exploration. We will get to know 
Anni Albers life as a student and teacher at the Bauhaus, her visual world and approach to new material for 
weaving. Her practice helped made textile design a form of art.  

This workshop is to be ideally held at the MoMA. It was one of the first places where her work as a textile 
artist, her first solo exhibition at a museum. I think its the ideal place.

Attendees could bring other materials to experiment with (plastic, wire, tread, magazines) During the workshop 
sharing and exchange with other members will happen

Guides: This is colouring/pattern making/collage guides that will help the participants get closer to the 
artist. The guides are inspired by the conditional design workbook (A reference Kathy kindly gave me while 
discussing our proposals)
