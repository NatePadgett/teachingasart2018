## Radical DIY Reality

A workshop based on the work of Joseph Beuys, in particular his relationship to personal mythology, symbolism and ritual.

This workshop will introduce students to a toolkit for temporary and subjective reality creation.

Using Chaos Magic as a starting point, we discuss the concept of belief technologies culminating in a class activity where participants design their own sigil imbuing with a representation their desired outcome.

We will then develop the sigil beyond the static image and into the 4th dimension; transforming it into an online persona, fictional self or avatar.
